Hi. My name is Duwayne Frieslaar.
This my solution to a pet adoption. This is how I solved the validation problem.
The resources I used was Scrimba, VsCode, ChatGPT, and I had a little help from my notes on the LMS.

This project was actually very easy, but still benefitted me in a way of introducing new knowledge.
